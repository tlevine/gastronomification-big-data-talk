Good day, thank you to everyone for coming, and thank you to BrightTALK
for organizing such a wonderful business intelligence summit.

I'm Thomas Levine. I've been working at the intersection of data analytics
and usability for the past 25 years, and I'm currently the director of product
at CSV. And as you might guess, I have some strong views on data visualization.

At CSV, we're *frustrated* with data visualization. Data visualization was
was fine 20 years ago, but it can't handle the enormous scales of big data
that we have today.
