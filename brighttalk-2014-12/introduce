Good day, thank you to everyone for coming.

I'm Thomas Levine. I've been working at the intersection of data analytics
and usability for the past 25 years, and I'm currently the director of product
at CSV. And as you might guess, I have some strong views on data visualization.

At CSV, we're *frustrated* with data visualization.
